    As a school student, you‚Äôve spent countless hours studying, working hard to maintain the highest grades, and participating in extracurricular activities to strengthen your application. And now, you‚Äôve received an invitation to attend a university interview ‚Äì congratulations! But as the day approaches, you find yourself struggling with nerves and anxiety. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs completely normal to feel this way. However, you don‚Äôt want your nerves to hinder your chances of success. <b>In this quick blog, we‚Äôll give you tips and tricks on how to come across as more confident in your university interviews and get into your dream university.</b>
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
    Prepare, prepare, prepare ü•ä 
  </Typography>
  <Typography paragraph>
  One of the most important ways to feel more confident is to prepare thoroughly for your interview. This means researching the university and the program you‚Äôre applying for, practicing common interview questions, and reviewing your application materials. The more prepared you are, the more confident you‚Äôll feel in your ability to answer questions and showcase your strengths. You need a bank of questions to use and get feedback on your answer to be able to reflect. Check out our free bank of qs <a href="/blog/post/dental-interview-question-bank"> here.</a>

  Dress for success  üë®‚Äçüè´ 
  </Typography>
  <Typography paragraph>

  Another great way to boost your confidence before an important job interview is to dress professionally. This doesn't necessarily mean having to wear a full suit and tie, but rather selecting an outfit that you feel confident and comfortable in. By feeling your best in what you're wearing, it will be reflected in your body language and communication skills. Dressing appropriately for an interview can also help to make a positive impression, as the interviewer will be able to see that you‚Äôve taken the time to carefully select your attire.
  </Typography>  
  <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
    Use storytelling to your advantage üßæ 
  </Typography>
  <Typography paragraph>
  Telling stories is a great way to showcase your strengths and experiences. When asked a question, try to provide specific examples that illustrate your skills and accomplishments. This will help make your answers more engaging and memorable for the interviewer. Don‚Äôt focus so much on what you did but rather look at what skills you got, what you learnt and how it has made you a better fit for the course you are applying for.
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
    Practice your body language üï∫ 
  </Typography>
  <Typography paragraph>
  Your body language speaks volumes, even before you open your mouth to answer questions. Before your interview, practice good posture, make eye contact, and avoid fidgeting or slouching. This will help you come across as more confident and poised. One way to ensure you do this in your online interviews is to make sure you look <b>at the camera not at the screen</b>. Looking at the camera mimics eye contact. Now this doesn‚Äôt mean you should stare down your interviewers soul - but rather show engagement and look to the side sometimes when thinking so you don‚Äôt look like a weirdo.
  </Typography>  
  <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
    Speak clearly and concisely  üîä 
  </Typography> 
  <Typography paragraph>
  During the interview, it‚Äôs important to speak clearly and concisely. Take your time to formulate your answers, and avoid rambling or going off-topic. Speak with a strong, steady voice and make sure to enunciate your words. One phrase we think you should use when you get a difficult question is ‚ÄúThat is actually a very interesting question, can I have a few moments to think about it please?‚Äô . This gives you time to think and provide an articulate answer and shows evidence to the interviewer that you are actively thinking. 
  </Typography>   
  <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
    Don‚Äôt show your full hand üÉè

  Now our final tip is a unique one - simply put when you answer a question you should not say everything to the interviewer. Think of a game of UNO - you don‚Äôt want to use all the +2s at once because you will lose all your lifelines. Instead you pace yourself - same philosophy with interviews, you want to allow yourself multiple examples for you answers but you do not necessarily have to mention them all at once. General rule is to mention one example per question and add on only when prompted or time permits. This will allow you to never be stumped when asked ‚Äò anything else‚Äô or ‚Äò do you have any more examples of x skill‚Äô.

  As a student applying to university, the interview process can be intimidating. But now, with the advent of AI-powered interview feedback, the process is becoming way more objective and transparent (which means you actually know if your answers are any good). In this blog post, we'll explore how AI is transforming admissions process and how <b>Auralyze.ai</b> can help you get into your dream career - let‚Äôs go!

  What is Ai-powered feedback? ü§ñ 
  </Typography>
  <Typography paragraph>
  <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/ckJF143W1gBS8Hk833" width="480" height="363" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen title="ai"></iframe><br />
  So you must be thinking wow Ai sounds cool but what does it actually do? Now , we wish you could put a question into Ai and get the perfect answer but the reality is, Ai is not a human - as such, you will never get that perfect natural sounding answer [ but it‚Äôs scarily close‚Ä¶].<br></br><br></br>
  Instead, Ai can be seen as more of a supportive tool that allows for quick and more consistent feedback on a large input of answers. This means that you can get very quick and **personalised** feedback on a load of answers without having to book in a 1-to-1 session or get generic feedback from family and friends [ like when your mum tells you your answer was GREAT and you just said your biggest weakness is that you ‚ÄúWoRk tOo hArD‚Äù‚Ä¶].<br></br><br></br>
  Any time you come across a question you can get super fast insights into what the question is actually looking for and whether or not your answer hits the key components of an exemplar answer.

  Can‚Äôt I just use ChatGPT? üíª 
  </Typography>
  <Typography paragraph>
  <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/SnbwVKTj0vBQSK47us" width="326" height="480" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen title="chatgpt"></iframe><br />
  Now ChatGPT is a super powerful language processing model and can give some pretty good generic feedback - however, it can‚Äôt provide high quality feedback for video interviews. <br></br><br></br>
  This is because video interviews capture not only the spoken language, but also nonverbal cues like body language and tone of voice, which can be just as important in understanding a candidate's communication skills and personality. <br></br><br></br>
  AI models that are specifically designed for video interviews, [Like us lol] , can analyse these nonverbal cues in addition to spoken language, providing more accurate and comprehensive feedback to candidates. So while ChatGPT may be a useful tool for certain applications, it may not be the best choice for providing feedback on interviews because we all know that communication is more than just what you say but also <i>how you say it.</i> <br></br><br></br>
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
  What are the benefits of using an Ai-based tool compared to traditional feedback? üë¥üëµ 
  </Typography>
  <Typography paragraph>
  <iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/LTYT5GTIiAMBa" width="480" height="317" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen title="baby"></iframe><br />
  Now with this one we don‚Äôt know where to start because there are just so many benefits and we wouldn‚Äôt be pouring our heart and soul into building something that isn‚Äôt worth using butttt let‚Äôs put our money where our mouth is: <br></br><br></br>
  One of the best advantages is that Ai-based tools provide greater objectivity, efficiency, and personalization to your feedback. Traditional interview feedback methods can be subjective and inconsistent, relying on the opinions of individual interviewers and you will get a million opinions on one question and 7 different ways to answer ‚Äò Tell me a bit about yourself‚Äô . With AI-based interview support, feedback is unbiased and based on an analysis of specific linguistic and non-linguistic factors that can impact communication effectiveness. This means you receive a more reliable and accurate assessment of your interview performance, which can help identify where to improve.<br></br><br></br> 
  Of course individual feedback is still great but you need strong foundations to build upon. There is no point in your paying to do a mock interview or do some interview training if you don‚Äôt have the basics locked in - would you ride a bike without training wheels on your first try? Ai-based feedback is tailored to <i>you</i> but built on exemplar answers - allowing for customisability and for you to track how well your answers match up to the theoretical best.<br></br><br></br>
  </Typography>
  <Typography variant="h6" paragraph>
  What else can Auralyze.ai do to improve my interview performance? üìàüìà 
  </Typography>
  <Typography paragraph>
  Well , we can offer feedback more efficiently than any person-centred service, particularly when it comes to online interviews. With AI, the capturing of interview data is automated which reduces the time and effort required to provide feedback. This means you get your feedback quickly and can practice a high volume of questions - which can give you the opportunity to adapt on the fly with feedback with each attempt. There is not point in answering 100 questions incorrectly - our Ai will increase your ability to identify your good and bad answers and push the needle towards success.<br></br><br></br>
  Finally, our tools will allow you to see how you rank against your peers. You can see what questions are easy/ hard so that you get realistic insights into how hard the average candidate finds that particular question. The problem with regular question banks is that you get to see a LOAD of questions but never get to know what the ‚Äòstandard‚Äô question looks like. You don‚Äôt just revise for one style of question in your exams - you know that there will be some questions worth 1 mark and others worth 12 - each one needs a different approach.<br></br><br></br>
  So are you convinced that Ai is truly revolutionising the interview game? If so try our service out and join our community of students looking to get into their dream universities <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/auralyzeai/shared_invite/zt-1pb1tc6ub-mrwYYF~_5v9bCGeTIJ5r2A"> here.</a>
